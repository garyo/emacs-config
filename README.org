#+title: Gary Oberbrunner's Emacs Configuration
#+author: Gary Oberbrunner

This is my Emacs config. Some parts date back to the 1980s, but I
recently refactored it using org-mode to organize its sections.

Clone this repo into ~$HOME/.config/emacs~ or ~$HOME/.emacs.d~ so Emacs will
find it. Should work on Windows (including WSL 1 and 2), Mac, and Linux.
Supports Emacs 26 and later, mostly.
