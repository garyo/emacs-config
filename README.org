#+title: Gary Oberbrunner's Emacs Configuration
#+author: Gary Oberbrunner

This is my Emacs config. Some parts date back to the 1980s, but I refactored it using org-mode to organize its sections. Then in 2024, I decided the org-mode literate config was more annoying than it's worth, just to look pretty in the github repo, so I refactored it into a set of specific config files.

Clone this repo into ~$HOME/.config/emacs~ or ~$HOME/.emacs.d~ so Emacs will find it. Should work on Windows (including WSL 1 and 2), Mac, and Linux. Supports Emacs 29 and later, mostly.

# Notes:
- Use ~(global-set-key (kbd "C-n") 'foo)~, not ~bind-key~.
- Use ~setopt~ to set customizable variables.
